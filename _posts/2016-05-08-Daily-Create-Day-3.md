Hello me, because nobody reads this blog except me, maybe one day. Anyway its daily create day three and its been really interesting even three days in to see what this project has done to me in terms of regulating my creativity and in hopes creating a more uniform schedule as well as increasing production. (sounds way too much like capitalism) 
For todays Daily Create project I've gone through and done all of the post work for a photo shoot that I did this past weekend, it was a wonderful photoshoot I look forward shooting with her again. 




I'm really happy with how these images came out. I can't say for certain that I want to do another shoot like this though. Getting the paint off of my poor friend was a bit of a task but the images came out very striking and something different then what I have traditionally done in my portfolio. I look forward to doing more projects that push my creativity within the realm of studio portraits.
