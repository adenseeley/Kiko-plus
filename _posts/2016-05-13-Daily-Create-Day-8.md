So for today, I have the Pre-Photoshop output files from a shoot I did a while back.(going through and re-cleaning out things.) Anyway, this was from when I was doing more of the powder photoshoots. (still really want to do another one!) So I had these photos that I was not quite satisfied with the original edit because I am the kind of person that does things 3+  times to get it just right, and then usually do it a couple extra just to make sure. So here is the screenshot from Adobe Bridge of the output files in their current state. A few of the files have been played with a bit but nothing major. All of this being said here are my WIP images.

Looking ahead to tomorrow I have a photo shoot planned with a friend of mine Zach Brown that is going to be pretty killer if it comes out how I want it to. Still juggling a few ideas around in my head of what exactly I want to do but I think whatever I choose it will be cool and I can't wait to see and share the results. In the meantime, tonight I'm going to start writing a tutorial on how I use capture one and my workflow with that. That being said, Catch ya later!
