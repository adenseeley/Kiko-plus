Hi there, So yesterday I posted some images of Tenzin and I thought I'd take a second to talk about them. They are part of my going through my folders of images and sorting everything out after the AP is over. Now that I am getting into a routine for shooting for myself I wanted to clean out and have everything fresh and tidy. I even had the thought to switch over to Adobe's Lightroom from Capture One which is my editing platform right now. I'd like to do some videos on Capture one in the future because there is a lot of content from the Phase community but some of it seemed a bit cumbersome to dive into. That being said keep an ear out for a video series and if not that a written segment on my workflow in capture one that I've adopted. Back to the images though I shot these a few weeks(two months ish) ago and have gotten around to editing them. Me being me I've now that the AP is over have gone back to shooting mostly for black and white, or to sound overly fancy monochrome, like that fancy over-priced Leica M that only shoots in black and white. Anyway, I like to shoot in black and white. A person a long time ago once told me(in reference to painting but I feel that the concept is still applicable) to start with two colors and master those two colors, far beyond just proficiency within the medium but to be great with just those two  colors, then move on to add color or other elements. Anyway, this has driven me to shoot in black and white creating focus in other areas such as composition and message behind the photo. This also allows me to work with traditional darkroom tequniqes much easier as I don't have access to color equipment for darkroom at the moment.  

So again I fell behind a day with the Daily Create project, It's become more of a one post for every 24 hours of my life. Anyway here it is the final upload for Daily Create day 6! Enjoy!
