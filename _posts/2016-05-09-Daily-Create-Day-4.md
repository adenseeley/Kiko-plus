Hello DailyCreate day four, I'm behind on my daily create so this is my second one today to play catch up to get back on track. Anyway, today I shot two really dumb photos of my teacher during our class today. He was vlogging so I decided to pick up a camera and start shooting him. After that him in his delightfully obnoxious self-decided to see how close he could get his face to my camera(Thanks Frank).  

Anyway, that's our AP photo class, we were actually finishing out the year today with the AP exam behind us now. Now we get to wait an excruciating two months to find out our scores, can't wait!
