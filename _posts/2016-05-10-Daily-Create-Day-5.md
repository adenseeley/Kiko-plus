Hey, it's Daily Create day five and I've got some images! I've been going through a lot... a lot a lot of back work and filing making sure I can use all of the space on my computer I can.. running out, anywhoo here are some of the images. 

So these images were shot after school a week or so ago. Playing with the concept of using a really wide angle lens and holding it at extreme angles.(almost Beastie Boys album cover esk) The style, I think when done right looks really cool, but is really tricky to do. Anyway kinda short today because I'm trying to pump through this sorting and re-editing so that I can get back to normal shooting. Have a fun photoshoot planned for Saturday can't wait to see how that comes out!
