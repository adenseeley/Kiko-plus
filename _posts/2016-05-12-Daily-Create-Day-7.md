Hello, So it was May Day today so during 6th period we all rushed outside to do nothing for the rest of the day. Through this process, I made some pictures. Here they are, I'll be the first to admit they are not my best work. I did not shoot for the majority of the day, but for the hour or so that I did shoot while avoiding water guns and buckets full of water being poured on me I managed to create these. 




Images — 



Happy May Day!
