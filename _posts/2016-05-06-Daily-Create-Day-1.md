Hey internet! So, I had this idea based on the 365 projects that have been popular lately around the photography community, also being inspired(just a wee wee bit don't get excited) by my teachers video blog. I decided to merge the ideas into a daily creative challenge that is not limited to 365 days or fails if it does not make the year mark. In that vein here is my first Image! 

So this image was shot spur the moment of my kid sister riding her skateboard before going to the pizza shop. I wish I hadn't had to push the ISO so far resulting in the crazy amount of noise in the image. For this image I don't see the noise as much of an issue though as much as I worried when I first shot the Image. Can't wait to watch this project progress in the coming weeks.
