Hey internet! (yes, I do know how cliché that sounds, get over it.) So I developed some photos this morning from a shoot a couple of days ago. This being a daily photo project I'm not sure if photos I took a few days ago but developed this morning count, Im going to say that they do! Or maybe I'll make a part two for today I don't know yet. Im looking to use this project as a daily photo project but also as a daily create project. Thus, I don't think that every day will contain a photograph in the typical sense but some form of artwork. That being said, here are the photographs!   

Laying out watching the sunset on my girlfriends roof I decided to grab a roll of film and take a moment to photograph her while the light was still there. Taking inspiration from a previously shot studio image with the legs in the upright position I've taken advantage of similar posing here while also creating symmetry between the skylights and the arcs in the trees of the background. 

Another quick shot while she was putting on her Pointe shoes before I shot the second image. As I further my work with the human body I am enjoying the square aspect ratio that originally I was a bit put off by, but now I have taken the time to embrace the aspect ratio and I think that it can contribute to the symmetry and flow of the images better then any other non square aspect ratio.    
Well thanks for reading, I do realize that its a day late, I feel asleep at 2 last night in front of my computer trying to get this out(yes I do realize 2am counts as the next day also) but here are the images for the second day of my daily create project can't wait to see how the work in the project progresses.
