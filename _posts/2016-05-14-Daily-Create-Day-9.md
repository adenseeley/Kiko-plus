So I think this has just turned into a daily blog of a creative person. So now that I've said that I can fuse more writing about my life in being creative, and showing some of the thought processes behind what is making me creative, also allowing me to explore what is driving me most to become creative, thus allowing me to channel my creativity more effectively. I think it is important to share your process for the learning of others but as well as for self-fulfillment. I find joy in sharing my work and I do not think I would have the energy to create if it wasn't for the happiness I get out of sharing. I know that this is an uncommon viewpoint among creators, and I am still very young in my creative journey.
Hey, So it's later in the day(then when I wrote the above paragraph) and my photo shoot  with Zach Brown(Brownie) is over captured some great images. I can't wait to share the final results, but they don't exist yet. The photos worked with a lot of harsher light than normal(our studio at school has one strobe with no modifiers, so harsh light it is when working with strobes) Someday I will learn to only click the shutter after the recycle beep on the flash. Anyhow,(I say that a lot.) I created images today, it feels good. Have a good day internet!
